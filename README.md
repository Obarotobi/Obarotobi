-# 👋 Hi, I’m Oluwatobi Obaro (@Obarotobi)

- 👀 I’m focused on the intersection of **AI, Finance, and Strategy** — building intelligent solutions for real-world decision-making.
- 🌱 I’m currently deep-diving into **Prompt Engineering**, **AI Risk Management**, and **AI-Augmented Financial Models**.
- 💬 I’m exploring how to reduce AI hallucination in critical finance workflows and develop tools that enhance forecast precision and hedge strategy optimization.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving **AI in Finance**, **Risk-Aware AI Systems**, and **Applied Prompt Engineering**.
- 📫 Reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oluwatobiobaro/) or GitHub DMs.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I believe the next wave of finance will be built by people who deeply understand **both financial logic and AI limitations** — and I'm all in on that future.
